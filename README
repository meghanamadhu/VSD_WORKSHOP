 Launch the openlane using the below openlane:                                        
                                         cd Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane 
                                         docker
                                        ./flow.tcl -interactive
                                         (Add image)
                                          package require openlane 0.9

There are already almost 40 designs in the design folder.(Add image)
                                       cd picorv32a
                                       cd src
                                       cd ../
   
                                       less config.tcl
The command to be run in the open lane window for design preparation is :
                                    prep -design picorv32a

After the design preparation stage a runs directory is created(in the normal window)
                                  cd runs/16-11_06-11
                                  cd tmp
                                  less merged.LEF
