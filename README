    Day 1                                                                                                                                    DIGITAL SoC Design Workshop
 Launch the openlane using the below openlane:                                        
                                         cd Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane 
                                         docker
                                        ./flow.tcl -interactive
                                         (Add image)
                                          package require openlane 0.9

There are already almost 40 designs in the design folder.(Add image)
                                       cd picorv32a
                                       cd src
                                       cd ../
   
                                       less config.tcl
The command to be run in the open lane window for design preparation is :
                                    prep -design picorv32a
(Add Image)
After the design preparation stage a runs directory is created(in the normal window)
                                  cd runs/16-11_06-11
                                  cd tmp
                                  less merged.lef
In the merged.lef File there will be cell information, metal layer information and so on.
Now go back one directory:
         cd ../
         cd results (Add Image)
Now go the openlane prompt
Run the below command for Synthesis:
                                run_synthesis
The synthesis step will take 3-5 minutes to complete the design.
The information about openlane can be obtained using
             efabless openlane
Inside the synthesis directory we can get the opensta timing and synthesis reports.

Day2 - Good Floorplan v/s Bad floorplan and introduction to library cells.

Width and height of core and die.
We are trying to find the width and height of core and die.
(Add Image)

A die which consist of core is small semiconductor material specimen on which the fundamental circuit is fabricated.
Utilization Factor = Area occupied netlist/Total area of the core
Aspect ration = Height / Width
